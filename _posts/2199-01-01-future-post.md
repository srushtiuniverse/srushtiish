hello there!

i have understood importance of priortising my health, both mental and physical. 

i learnt it the hard way that, the things which "seem" to give us comfort aren't actually comfort worthy. they're just a shield we have on ourself when we are afriad of something. we won't even acknowledge it and we will go on to thinking, im doing all that i can to save myself but there is nothing to save yourself from! 

my top focus related to health:
     1. stress and anxiety  
     2. losing fat 
     3. gaining muscle 
     4. hairloss + dandruff
     5. metabolism and gut 
     6. sleep 
     (but summing it up it's just fixing my thyriod problems)

i talked to nate lawrance about my problems and started taking some supplements. 

i have ordered stuff and its still yet to come but here are the things im taking currently 

1. [magnesium 440mg.][https://www.amazon.in/Boldfit-Magnesium-Supplement-Oxide-Relaxation/dp/B08VGH1KR9?pd_rd_w=mq3ZL&content-id=amzn1.sym.41e82722-cd55-497c-9292-c776a64a5fea&pf_rd_p=41e82722-cd55-497c-9292-c776a64a5fea&pf_rd_r=8PRZBXYB73GWFMJSR7FQ&pd_rd_wg=XiNQL&pd_rd_r=0d059f95-35ae-42b9-9e52-129442ec09dd&pd_rd_i=B08VGH1KR9&ref_=pd_bap_m_grid_dv_rp_0_2_sc&th=1]
2. [taurine][https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0BS478FWX?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_dt_b_asin_image]
3. [gelatin][https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B08VWJYRWV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1]
4. [vitamin k2 mk7][https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07XPD9V2Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1]

i haven't taken vitamink2 mk7 yet but im starting to feel bit less stressed these days cause of others. 

some notes: 
  - nate told me to get magnesium 400mg but it wasn't avaliable 
  - taurine works really good if taken 0.5mg 3x instead of one throughout the day
  - gelatin does not have powder like structure, im yet to understand how to consume it (i will update on this)
  - i was supposed to get vitamink2 mk4 but it isn't avaliable 
  - i tried taking aspirin too, but i didn't have a good reaction to it so i decided it's better not to take it.
